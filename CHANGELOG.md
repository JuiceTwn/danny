# Changelog

## 1.0.0

First complete version of Danny: a multi-tenant API and a responsive web app (PWA and desktop-install from one build).

- Invite-only accounts, one workspace per user, sessions in revocable cookies
- Chat with streaming replies, a tool registry, and an approval gate: anything that would leave the app becomes a card for the user's tap
- Memory the user can see and delete
- Approvals are recorded, never executed
- Daily spend cap and a kill switch, enforced before every model call
- Tenant isolation enforced by Postgres row-level security
- Memory, messages, approval drafts and titles, and connection secrets encrypted at rest with per-workspace keys and key rotation
- Owner tools: approve invite requests, make invite links, see spend per person
- Docker Compose, one-command setup script, CI

Known gaps at 1.0:

- Real Anthropic API calls have not been run; tests use a scripted model. Without a key the server runs in demo mode.
- The Docker image and `setup.sh` have not been built or run end to end.
- Install flow and offline mode have not been tried on real phones.
- Model prices in config are placeholders.
- Nothing is sent outside the app yet (no email, calendar, or social connectors).
- Invite emails are not sent; the owner copies the link.
